# Personal-Finance-Study-Guide-with-Notebook-LM
This project demonstrates the use of Google's NotebookLM as an AI-powered learning assistant to create an interactive study guide on introductory personal finance. By curating and synthesizing multiple open-source financial documents, this notebook provides structured learning materials, strategic prompts, and critical analysis tools.

# Learning Objectives
1. Understand core persona finance principles through active AI-assisted learning.
2. Create reusable study materials and prompts for ongoing education.
3. Practice source synthesis across multiple authoritative documents.
4. Develop critical thinking skills for evaluating financial information.

## Sample Outputs
### Glossary Entry
#### Prompt: "Analyze the advice about credit card usage across all three sources. What patterns emerge? Are there conflicting recommendations?"

#### Output: "The analysis of the provided sources (which include materials on Personal Financial Planning, Investment Analysis, and the Securities Market) reveals a fairly consistent pattern of advice regarding the use of credit cards in the context of personal finance.

The documents covering Personal Financial Management identify the credit card not as a cash flow management tool, but primarily as a high-cost, high-risk form of revolving credit, recommending its exclusion from consumption financing.

Patterns of Advice on Credit Card Use
Three main patterns emerge from the sources regarding credit cards and revolving credit:

1. High Cost and Extreme Risk
The primary pattern is the discouragement of using credit cards for debt due to their prohibitive cost and high risk.
• Revolving credit (which includes overdraft protection and credit cards) is classified as the most expensive credit and should be avoided.
• The interest rates charged in the market for revolving credit are higher than those for other credit modalities due to its high risk for the financial institution (being an unsecured loan, without a maturity date or pre-established payment conditions).

2. Consumption Financing Should Be Avoided
The sources strongly advise against using credit cards to finance consumption expenses, as this compromises future income.
• Financing the credit card bill or making installment purchases (retail credit) are considered traps that should be "crossed off the map," and the individual should pay for consumption expenses with available cash.
• The recommendation is clear: Acquire the habit of saving and paying cash. The use of credit should be reserved only for acquiring assets that build wealth, such as real estate financing.

3. Connection with Behavioral Biases
Credit card use is directly linked to behavioral biases that harm an individual's financial health.
• Present Bias (or Hyperbolic Discounting) is identified as a tendency that leads people to take on more debt by excessively prioritizing immediate reward.
• The mind tends to create the illusion that purchasing power is greater than it actually is.
• To combat this bias and the illusion of greater purchasing power, it is recommended to reduce the credit limit and decrease credit card usage.

Conflicting Recommendations
There are no conflicting recommendations about credit card use in the examined documents. The texts are unanimous in positioning revolving credit as an expensive and dangerous choice that should be avoided in personal financial planning, with the goal of reducing debt and increasing savings capacity.

The Investment Analysis documents (such as "TOP-Analise-de-Investimentos.pdf") and the material on the Securities Market ("TOP-Mercado-de-Valores-Mobiliarios-Brasileiro.pdf") focus on assets, capital markets, and corporate governance and, therefore, do not contain direct advice on personal finances or the use of credit cards."
